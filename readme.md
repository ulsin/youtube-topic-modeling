# Topic Modeling for YouTube Trending videos

Wanted a project to replicate some of the things I learned during my internship at Schibsted, but felt like I had to make a new project as not to rely on Schibsted's data.

This project aims to find clusters of topics based on titles from YouTube's trending videoes, with a dataset from Kaggle.

The project uses SBERT for getting sentence embeddings, UMAP for dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN for clustering and TF-IDF for finding topics within clusters.

More documentation and code coming soon!
